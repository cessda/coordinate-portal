# COORDINATE Portal

**IMPORTANT**: This repository was used during the development of version 4 of CDC Searchkit as an output of the COORDNATE project and is now archived. Further development will occur in the [cessda.cdc.searchkit](https://github.com/cessda/cessda.cdc.searchkit) repository.

This repository contains all source code for the COORDINATE Portal web application.

CESSDA's repositories are used for harvesting and indexing with very minimal changes to Elasticsearch mappings:
[cessda.metadata.harvester](https://github.com/cessda/cessda.metadata.harvester)
[cessda.cdc.osmh-indexer.cmm](https://github.com/cessda/cessda.cdc.osmh-indexer.cmm)

## Prerequisites

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 18 (LTS) is required to install and run this application.

You will need an existing local or remote Elasticsearch version 8 instance setup and running.

## Quick Start

Please be aware of *Known Issues* (see bottom) before running.

1. Check *Prerequisites* and install any required software.
2. Clone the repository to your local workspace.
3. Open a Command Prompt/Terminal window and navigate to the project root directory.
4. Enter `npm install` to install the application and all required dependencies.
5. Set the required environment variables (see *Configuration* below).
6. Run the application using one of the following commands.
    * Development: `npm run startdev`
    * Production: `npm run startprod` (Requires the application to be built. See *Building* below.)

> **Building:** In order to run the application in production, it must first be built using the `npm run build` command. This will compile assets into the `/dist` directory. This is not needed if the application is started with `npm run startdev`.  
> **Updating:** When fetching/pulling new builds it is recommended to run `npm install` again. This will ensure all locally installed dependencies match their development environment counterparts.  
> **Testing:** Tests can be run using `npm run test`. Code coverage will be reported in the `/coverage` directory.

## Configuration

The application can be configured using the following environment variables.

| Variable                     | Default Value | Description
| ---------------------------- | ------------- | -----------
| `PASC_DEBUG_MODE`            | `false`       | Enables debug mode which outputs additional debugging information in the user interface and web browser console.
| `PASC_PORT`                  | `8088`        | The port number which will be used to access this web application.
| `PASC_ELASTICSEARCH_URL`     | `http://localhost:9200/` | The web address of the Elasticsearch instance which powers all searches.
| `SEARCHKIT_ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME` | `undefined` | The username to use when accessing a secured Elasticsearch cluster.
| `SEARCHKIT_ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD` | `undefined` | The password to use when accessing a secured Elasticsearch cluster.
| `SEARCHKIT_LOG_LEVEL`        | `info`        | The logging level used for server side events.
| `SEARCHKIT_USE_JSON_LOGGING` | `false`       | Whether to log using JSON rather than plain text.

Set environment variables using the following syntax.

* Windows: `set PASC_PORT=80`
* macOS/Linux: `export PASC_PORT=80`
* Dockerfile: `ENV PASC_PORT=80`

If running in a development environment using JetBrains WebStorm (see *Tooling* below), variables can be set within the IDE [using this documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/run-debug-configuration-node-js.html).

## Tooling

For development, the following software tools are recommended and have full support for the technologies/languages used in this project.

* [JetBrains WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) with [Nuclide](https://nuclide.io/) (EOL Announced) package
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## How To

### Add a new Collection (Thematic View)

* See instructions in `/docs/collections/howto.md`.

### Add a new language

1. Create a new language file in the `/src/i18n/` directory, using the 2 letter language ISO code for the directory name. It is recommended to copy the English file `en/translation.json` and use that as a template/starting point.
2. Add your translations to the new file. Basic HTML mark-up is supported but its use should be limited. Some strings use variables which are defined as `%(VARIABLE)s`. Do not modify the JSON structure or object keys.
3. Notify the application about this new file by adding it to the languages array defined in `/src/utilities/language.js`. It is expected that each language will have its own Elasticsearch index. Use the following syntax:

```javascript
{
  code: 'code',          // The 2 letter ISO code for this language.
  label: 'label',        // The native label for this language.
  index: 'cmmstudy_code' // The Elasticsearch index containing data for this language.
}
```

> Translations can be displayed in mark-up using `const { t, i18n } = useTranslation();` and `t("filters.summary.label")` where `t` takes the JSON path to the specific string required.

### Add a new field

1. Each study retrieved from Elasticsearch is first routed through the `getStudyModel()` method located in `/src/utilities/metadata.js`. This cleans the data and applies type restrictions. Add the new field to the object returned from this method. Like other fields, it should be provided from Elasticsearch as a child property of the `data._source` object.
2. If the field should be displayed on the search page for each result, modify the `/src/components/Result.jsx` component. Add additional HTML mark-up as necessary and the new field will be available as a child property of the `item` object. For example `<p>{item.newField}</p>`.
3. If the field should be displayed on the study detail page, modify the `/src/components/Detail.jsx` component. Add additional HTML mark-up as necessary and the new field will be available as a child property of the `item` object. For example `<p>{item.newField}</p>`.
4. Remember to add new strings to the translations located in `/src/locales` if necessary (i.e. for the new field label etc.)
5. Remember to modify the `getJsonLd()` method if you want the new field to be available in the JSON-LD Schema (see how to *Modify Schema.org JSON-LD* below).

### Modify search filters

All search filters are created in `/src/containers/SearchPage.jsx` and their Elasticsearch configuration is in `/server/helper.ts`.

Example of [RefinementList](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/widgets/refinement-list/react/) from InstantSearch:

```json
{
  attribute: "country",
  field: "searchField",
  type: "string",
  nestedPath: "studyAreaCountries"
}
```

```jsx
<RefinementList attribute="country" searchable sortBy={['name:asc']} limit={200} showMore={true} showMoreLimit={500}
                classNames={{
                  searchBox: 'focus-visible',
                  checkbox: 'focus-visible',
                  list: 'ais-CustomRefinementList'
                }}/>
```

High `limit` can be used here because of the `ais-CustomRefinementList` class that makes the values horizontally scrollable. Usually lower `limit`, e.g. 16, is recommended, along with `showMore` set to false. Setting searchable is always recommended for any filter that supports it.

### Modify sorting fields

The list of available fields for sorting can be modified in the `/server/helper.ts` and then set in `/src/containers/SearchPage.jsx`.

### Modify Elasticsearch queries

Queries performed against Elasticsearch are defined in `/server/helper.ts` and `/server/elasticsearch.ts`. Client being used is set in `/src/utilities/searchkit.js` but also defined in `/server/helper.ts` like most of the queries.

### Modify Schema.org JSON-LD (used by Google Dataset search)

1. General organisation information and social media links are generated for every page. JSON-LD can be modified in `/src/components/Footer.jsx`.
2. Dataset metadata is generated on the detail page for a single study record. JSON-LD can be modified in `/src/utilities/metadata.js` using method `getJsonLd()`. This method takes a study returned from `getStudyModel()` as its input.
