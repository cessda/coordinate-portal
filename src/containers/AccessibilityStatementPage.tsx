          <p>CESSDA is committed to ensuring digital accessibility for people with disabilities. We are continually improving the user experience for everyone, and applying the relevant accessibility standards.</p>
        </div>
        <div className="column">
          <h2 className="title is-5">Conformance status</h2>
          <p>The <a href='https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/' target='_blank' rel="noreferrer">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a> define requirements for designers and developers to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. They outline three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA. This data catalogue is largely conformant with WCAG 2.2 Level AA, meaning it meets most accessibility standards. However, a few minor issues remain, which are detailed below.</p>
        </div>
        <div className="column">
          <h2 className="title is-5">Non-Accessible Content</h2>
          <p>We&apos;ve fixed most accessibility issues in the data catalogue through updates and improvements. However, some issues remain because they depend on third-party components. These are listed below, and we&apos;ll keep an eye on future updates to see if they can be resolved.</p>
        </div>
        <div className="column">
          <h3 className="subtitle">The non-accessible areas include:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Feedback form does not have autocomplete attributes (WCAG 1.3.5 Identify Input Purpose)</li>
            <li>The range input for collection years lacks accessible names for the minimum and maximum values (WCAG 4.1.2: Name, Role, Value)</li>
            <li>The &apos;Hits per page&apos; selection lacks an accessible name (WCAG 4.1.2: Name, Role, Value)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div className="column">
          <h2 className="title is-5">Feedback</h2>

        <div className="column">
          <h2 className="title is-5">Compatibility with browsers and assistive technology</h2>
          <p>The data catalogue&apos;s accessibility features are currently undergoing testing primarily on Firefox and Chrome browsers. The screen reader mainly used in testing is NVDA. Other major browsers and screen readers should also be compatible, but some aspects of the website may not display optimally, especially when using older versions.</p>

          <h2 className="title is-5">Assessment approach</h2>
          <p>CESSDA assessed the accessibility of the data catalogue by self-evaluation.</p>
